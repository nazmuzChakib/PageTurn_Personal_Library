## 🧠 What Is This App?

**PPL Book Tracker** is a cross-platform Flutter application that helps users manage their personal book collection without relying on external services. It stores books locally using shared preferences and allows:

* Adding books manually or via ISBN lookup from Google Books API
* Tracking read/unread status
* Marking books as Wishlist
* Recording lending/borrowing details
* Organizing books by author, category, and more
* Viewing quick charts and statistics about your library

All data can be backed up or restored using JSON files — including *book cover images* encoded in Base64 — giving complete control and portability over your library data.
